        <h2>Why Smudge?</h2>
        <p>
          Many modern websites have implemented a variety of trackers that collect data on users, 
          allowing for cross-site identification through this digital "fingerprint". Smudge can help 
          users distort their online fingerprint. While a tool like PrivacyBadger blocks the 
          trackers themselves, the idea here is to essentially “poison” the datasets being 
          used to identify someone in the first place, by randomly changing/falsifying the 
          data points (like user agent or screen size). Since those using the plugin/extension 
          will appear to have different browsing data each time they visit a website, it will 
          make it more difficult to positively identify a user through these somewhat underhanded 
          means, and in a way devalue the information that is being sold in the first place.

        <h2>What Smudge Is (and Isn't) Doing For You</h2>
        <p>
          Smudge seeks to do the following for its users:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conceal Attributes. Hide the true HTTP header and Javascript attributes of users
            connecting to any website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a simple, quick way for users to obscure their browsing data. We want the
            application we build to be accessible to a wide spectrum of users, including those
            who aren't familiar with web technologies. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow users some level of control. Users should be able to change some of the spoofed
            data themselves, to ensure browsing functionality is not impeded. As well as choosing
            what websites to not change their fingerprints on.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, Smudge <em>isn't</em>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Able to run on every web browser. We intend to implement this on Firefox.
            We do not plan to implement this for every web browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            A sandbox environment. Smudge runs locally and will not protect users from
            dangerous files or websites they encounter through some kind of virtualized
            environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Able to run on mobile devices. We intend to implement this OS-agnostic on 
            desktop, but will not support mobile devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            An ad blocker. While we might change outgoing request data going to
            an advertiser, we are not blocking ads.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <h2>What Smudge Is (and Isn't) Protecting You From</h2>
        <p>
          Smudge's security goals include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Anonymity. Our extension should provide the user with a level of anonymity,
            such that their message cannot be linked to them in a larger dataset.
          </li>
          <li>
            Efficacy of Fingerprinting as a whole. We also aim to poison the larger space of
            fingerprinting datasets as a whole, to discourage the practice as well as make it
            less effective.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, these goals <em>do not</em> include:
        </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Thwarting Mobile fingerprinting. We will not be attempting to extend
            our implementation to include mobile fingerprinting which is based on
            applications a user has installed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performing encryption. We don't attempt to encrypt or otherwise alter user data;
            rather, we change metadata only.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disabling trackers. We are not protecting users from seeing ads, just
            preventing the ads from reasonably identifying users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Altering software. We are not actually changing any of the software, downloaded fonts,
            or other features of a user's browsing data--only spoofing them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions Smudge Uses</h2>
        <p>
          You might have noticed that Smudge requests to read and change data on
          all the sites you visit. Scary! However, Smudge isn't actually storing
          any of the data it comes across while you browse. It needs these permissions
          in order to compare the information being requested by trackers as you browse
          to the presets Smudge uses to hide your identity, then send back that false
          information instead of your real data.
        </p>

        <h2>I Installed Smudge. Now What?</h2>
        <p>
          Smudge isn't a universal band-aid--it still requires users to be thoughtful
          about their browsing habits and data trail. You can find details specifically
          addressing what Smudge is <em>not</em> above, but it's also important
          to note that Smudge is an extension in beta, and thus not entirely polished.
          One important rough edge is that users must periodically clear their cookies
          in order to ensure that Smudged attributes are being changed regularly and 
          not stored in the cache--as you should be doing anyway! In order to take 
          full advantage of Smudge's features, please delete your cookies often.
